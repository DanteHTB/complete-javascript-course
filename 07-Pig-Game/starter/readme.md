### Rules
&emsp; On a turn, a player rolls the die ðŸŽ² repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, adding up (__Hold__) the numbers rolled on the die ðŸŽ². However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited. Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score from previous turns, just the total earned during that particular roll.
<br /> &emsp; A player has to choose to hold (stop rolling the die ðŸŽ²) if they do not want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points from this turn. If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score.
<br /> &emsp; When a player reaches a total of 100 points, that player is declared the winner and the game ends.

* ![#94bb80](https://via.placeholder.com/15/94bb80/94bb80.png) Green - Shows what happens as soon as one action is executed
* ![#8ba6ce](https://via.placeholder.com/15/8ba6ce/8ba6ce.png) Blue - `If-Else` where we check for a certain condition
* ![#c58280](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c58280/c58280.png) Red - Finish Line :)

### Summary

* **First Player to Reach 100 Points Wins the Game**

  * Use `Roll Dice` to get a value from 1 to 6
  * The values from 2 to 6 gets added in the `Current` block and you can roll the dice again
  * Using the `Hold` button will add the `Current` score to your `Total Score`, preventing resets from 1 rolls
  * If you roll 1 on the dice, you lose all of your `Current` points and ends your turn
  * You can use `New Game` to reset the game instead of refreshing your page :)
